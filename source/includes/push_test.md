## Push Test
From here you can send messages and test the API to send push notifications.
By default the Payload is:

```
{
    "users": ["user1","user2"],
    "message": "This is a test message!"
}
```

Into the _Server Response_ section you can see detailed information on which steps BaasBox performed to elaborate the provided JSON.
