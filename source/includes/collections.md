## Collections

A collection is a sort of bucket where you can store documents. Documents are schema-less, which means that there are no constraints on their fields definition or data type.
Another very important feature to know about collections is that the records stored have a per-user-record-security-level, meaning that each record can be accessed only by the user who created it. There are APIs to grant or revoke privileges to other users. See [Grant permissions on a Document](#grant-permissions-on-a-document).
