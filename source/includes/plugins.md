## Plugins

Since BaasBox 0.9.0 it is possibile to write your own plugin thanks to the Server Side Code (engine).

The home of the plugins section is the following:
![Plugins Home](images/Console_0.9.0/plugins_home.png)

To create a new plugin, click on the "New..." button and choose a plugin name.

The names of the plugins must be in the form _namespace.plugin_name_, the namespace "baasbox" is reserved.

Now you have created a new plugin, here is a brief explanation of the editor page.
