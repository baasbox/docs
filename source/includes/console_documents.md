## Documents


Documents are objects stored in the embedded NoSQL database and grouped
in "Collections".

![Documents](images/Console_0.8.1/documents.png)

In this section you have the list of all
your documents, but you have to select an existing collection at first.
In fact you can see all the documents relating to a specific collection.
Of course you also have the search tool. 

![Documents table](images/Console_0.8.1/baasbox-documents-table.png)

Each document has a unique ID, generated by the server once it is stored.
Data documents are stored and retrieved JSON format.

Documents are accessible only by the user who created them. APIs exist
to grant and revoke permissions to the single users or roles. See also [Grant/Revoke](#grant-permissions-on-a-document).
