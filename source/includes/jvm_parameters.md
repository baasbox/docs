Since BaasBox runs on top of a Java Virtual Machine, you can use any JVM options to perform a fine tuning of your BaasBox.
By default no options are used.
A complete reference to the JVM parameters can be found [here](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/tech/vmoptions-jsp-140102.html).

These settings cannot be modified at runtime.
