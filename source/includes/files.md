## Files

Users can upload files. Only the user who created them can access such files, besides administrators and users who have the role of “BackOffice”. 
The maximum size of a file is 2GB, but we do not recommend reaching such size, since BaasBox is a software that provides backend services for mobile Apps. Currently we do not support resume functions for upload and download.
