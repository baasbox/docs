### The response 

Every response generated by BaasBox as a result of a REST call is a JSON
object. In case of error, the data returned are more detailed and are useful to
understand why the request was rejected. 

Baasbox adds a "Date" header to every response reporting the date/time info, formatted using the RFC 1123 specification.
