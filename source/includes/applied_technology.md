## Applied Technology

BaasBox is written mostly in Java, with some code in [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/). It uses the [Play Framework 2.2.4](http://www.playframework.com/) and it incorporates the core of the [OrientDB 1.7.10 database](http://www.orientechnologies.com/orientdb/). This will allow BaasBox to natively manage the relations between JSON objects and to link
objects and queries without using specific abstractions or having to simulate them on the applicative level. OrientDB was recently surveyed and entered Gartner's Magic Quadrant.
