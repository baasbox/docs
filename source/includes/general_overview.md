# General Overview

BaasBox is a server that makes available a set of functions for the
backend of mobile applications. All you need is a **Java Virtual Machine
1.8 or later**. BaasBox already has everything you need
for it to work: an application server and a DB server. 
BaasBox was born to be simple to use and manage. To migrate a BaasBox instance from a
server to another, you just have to zip the database folder and copy it
into the server target folder. Moreover, it is ready to use without
changing the configuration parameters. You just have to
launch the command ``./start`` (or ``start.bat`` on Windows) and BaasBox will
run. Should you need it, you can apply customized configuration parameters. See the [configuration section](#configuration).
