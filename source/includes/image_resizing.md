## Image resizing

In the settings you can define an array of possible resizing policies for images.

![Image resize settings](images/Console_0.8.1/image_resize.png)

Examples are: 

* `25%` : scales the image to 25% 
* `<=80px`: scales the image so that the smallest dimension is at most 80px.

See [Retrieve a file](#retrieve-a-file) on how to use these values.
