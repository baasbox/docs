## Server Log
By clicking on this menu item, a new window (or tab) will be opened in your web browser. In this new window, from now on, you will see the BaasBox verbose log (not available on the BaasBox cloud service).
This feature is quite useful to know what happens behind the scene without access to the server to inspect the logs.
