## Assets


Assets are special objects. They are public by default, but only
administrators can create or delete them. They can store arbitrary data
(in JSON format), or entire files. Each Asset can store a file and its
associated data. Assets do not have IDs generated by the server, but you
can, indeed you MUST, assign a unique name to them. You can subsequently
use these names to reference the assets.

In this section you have a detailed list of all your assets
with information fields like Icon, Name, Meta, Size, Type, Download and
Actions. Of course you also have the search tool. If you want to create
a new asset, click on the New Asset button and you will see the
following window:
