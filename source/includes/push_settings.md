## Push Settings

The Push Settings section allows you to enable/disable apps for sending push notifications.
From BaasBox 0.8.4 it is possible to manage apps for sending push notifications.
In particular BaasBox support **max three apps**. It's possible to switch app settings by the tab section.

- App #1 (Default) is the section for the first app, which is the default app
- App #2 is the section for the second app
- App #3 is the section for third app

For Android Key (Sandbox/Production), remember to check the availability of Google Cloud Messaging for Android, in Google Play Developer Console.
If disabled or if Android Key is wrong it will be returned error and no key are stored.

When the settings is configured, is possible to enabled the specific app.

**Notice: Is possible to switch mode, with app enabled, only if the settings for the other mode are configured.**
