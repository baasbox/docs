BaasBox is based on the [Play Framework 2.2.4](http://www.playframework.com). This means that it accepts all the options available for any Play application.
A complete reference of such options can be found [here](http://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.2.4/ProductionConfiguration).

These settings cannot be modified at runtime.
