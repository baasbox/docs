BaasBox will start and it will listen on port 9000. Visit [http://localhost:9000/](http://localhost:9000/)
with your preferred browser. If everything worked fine, the BaasBox logo
should appear. Now you can open the administrator console: [http://localhost:9000/console](http://localhost:9000/console )

Thatâ€™s all! BaasBox is ready to go and to serve your apps! To stop the server just halt (Ctrl-C) the shell script.
