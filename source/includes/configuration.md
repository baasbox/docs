# Configuration
BaasBox does not need any configuration to start. However, you can modify many parameters to fit your specific needs.
You can act on different setting levels depending on your goal.
The setting levels are:

- [JVM parameters](#jvm-parameters)

- [Play Framework settings](#play-framework-settings) 

- [BaasBox settings](#baasbox-settings)

- [App settings](#app-settings)


To set an option you have to type it as a _start_ script parameter.
